# Task-7
# Logistic Regression – Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
To build a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic and evaluate it using classification metrics.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded Titanic dataset
2. Performed data inspection
3. Handled missing values in Age and Embarked
4. Removed unnecessary columns
5. Encoded categorical variables
6. Applied feature scaling
7. Split data into training and testing sets
8. Trained Logistic Regression model
9. Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
10. Plotted confusion matrix
11. Plotted ROC curve and calculated AUC score

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- AUC Score

## Final Outcome
This project demonstrates binary classification using Logistic Regression and proper model evaluation techniques.
